---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### You MUST Do These Steps:
1. ✅ Create a Firebase project (free, ~15 minutes)
2. ✅ Update `src/firebase.js` with YOUR config
3. ✅ Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. ✅ Follow SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### Optional but Recommended:
- Set yourself as owner in Firebase Console
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting (free)
- Customize colors and branding
- Set up billing integration (Stripe/PayPal)

## 🎯 What Works Out of the Box

Everything except billing integration!

The billing page exists and is ready, but since you mentioned "payments 
will be done by another company," you'll need to:
1. Sign up with Stripe or PayPal
2. Get API credentials
3. Follow their integration guide
4. Add their SDK to the billing page

All the UI and structure is ready for this!
